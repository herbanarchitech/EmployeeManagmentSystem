+++Project Objectives++++
  ----  Make a responsive Spring Boot application based on MVC architecture (Model, View, Controller)
   ---- Application should implement all CRUD operations, utilizing Entities, Controller classes, and Interfaces
    ----Establish a connection with your React project as a View layer that includes Components for CRUD operations
    ----For a responsive app, install Bootstrap, or use Media Queries, or any other responsive plugins of your choice
    ----Access your RESTful API from your React project using axios (http library) and display in a formatted view (CSS)
    ----Add Router functionality in your React project

++++Stretch Goals ++++
  ---Create authentication functionality for login (if user is authenticated, then user gains access to the management tool. Otherwise, they receive a message:
  "Access Denied: Invalid User")
   --- Publicly deployed app (Heroku, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) and link your live site in your README
    May use a third 3rd party api that relates to your REST API (Highly Recommended)
